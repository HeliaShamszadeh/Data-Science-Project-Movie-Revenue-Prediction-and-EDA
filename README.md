## 📊 Project Overview

The project consists of two main parts:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding the dataset and identifying key features
- Analyzing trends related to:
  - Movie budgets
  - Genres
  - Release dates
  - Cast and directors
  - Popularity scores
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

### 2. Revenue Prediction
- Predicting movie revenue using regression models
- Feature engineering to create meaningful predictors
- Comparison of multiple models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
